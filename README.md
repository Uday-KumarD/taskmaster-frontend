Technologies used - Next.js, Bootstrap, Redux and RTK for frontend
                    Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js


1) You can select your roles like Manager and User while registering, but you cannot be an Admin
2) I have to explicitly change the role of the user to Admin in MongoDB atlas to make a person an admin
 use these credentials to check as an admin
    Email - doddaudaykumar@gmail.com
    Password - Company@123
3) Both Admin and Manager can assign a task to anyone, but user is just able to see the tasks that are assigned to him/her
4) You can perform CRUD operations on tasks
5) Only Admin can promote the user to manager
